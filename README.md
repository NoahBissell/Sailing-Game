# Sailing-Game

This was a small hobby project implementing a 2D SPH fluid simulation in compute shaders, rendered as a 2D texture based on the smoothed velocity of the particles. I got it up to around 10000 particles. I also tinkered with adding two-way interaction bewteen rigidbodies and the water simulation to have a boat floating across the surface. To give the feeling of endless water I wrapped the simulation beyond the left and right edges of the screen, allowing the boat to get up to speed.
